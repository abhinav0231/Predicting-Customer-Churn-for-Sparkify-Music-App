# Predicting-Customer-Churn-for-Sparkify-Music-App

### >  Summary

This prject is part of the Data Science Capstone Project. Any project can be chosen by the student, but here we are going to work on the project that is provided by Udacity itself. This is to Predict based on a Imaginative Company dataset(Sparkify) which is a Digital Music Streeming company, We are using the medium sized dataset that is around 231 mb in size. We are going to use Spark to Do our analysis and the main objective is to Analysis and create a Model to indentify Customers likely to Churn and leave the platform. IBM Watson Sudio will be used and within it wll use the Python3.6 with Spark environment notebook to carry out the analysis. We learn how to use Spark MLlib to build machine learning models with large datasets, far beyond what could be done with non-distributed technologies like scikit-learn. The blog post for the work done here can be found in the following medium link to the blog.

### > Project Workflow

           > Loading the data as Spark datafram
           > Getting the Spark session up and running 
           > Loading the dataset
           > Performing desctiptive analysis
           > Cleaning the data
           > Performing EDA
           > Performing Feature Engineering to create and extract out most informative data
           > Modeling

### > Evaluation

Accuracy and AUC Score is used as the Evaluation matrix . Gradient Boosted Tree Classifier gives us the best result with 96% of Accuracy and AUC score of  .989 before Hyperparamter Tuning.
